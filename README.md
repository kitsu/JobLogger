# Job Logger

An *ASP.net core* based application for logging job search information per [Washington
state unemployment guidelines](https://esd.wa.gov/unemployment/job-search-requirements).

## Getting Started

To run this you will may need to re-create the `wwwroot/lib` and
`wwwroot/scripts` directories. Bower should then be able to populate the lib
directory. The scripts directory will populate when the Typescript code is
built (which is configured in gulpfile.js to happen on project build).

This project was created using Visual Studio Community 2015 on Windows 10.
Additional configuration may be required on other platforms/IDEs.

## Deployment

I intend to deploy this on Azure, but it is still early days.
